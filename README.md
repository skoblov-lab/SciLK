# SciLK: a Scientific natural Language Toolkit
SciLK (pronounced as "silk") is a natural language toolkit created and 
optimised specifically for text-mining applications in natural sciences 
(primarily biology and chemistry). As of this moment, this package is purely
experimental and is bound to be unstable for some time to come. Stable published
models will be stored in separate stale branches until the master branch has
matured. The list of such branches:

 - `chemdner-pub` - a text tokeniser and chemical named entity recognition model
 trained on the CHEMDNER corpus (publication pending). **Update** We've added Windows support.
